# NBodyCalculation
This was a final project for one of my classes. I decided to revisit and clean up the code to show improvement of my skills over time.

I tried to put an emphasis on using classes and tried to implement with what i've learned. I still believe there can be some improvments though. A lot of the functionality
implemented with the matrix objects seem kind of forced to the situation and not general to the object. It's not as likely some of those functions would be used in other functions.

I'm glad with the improvments that can be seen and will continue to learn how to improve my skills.

To give a further explanation of the code, the purpose was to simulate n-body gravity problems using a specific technique learned in class. The technique taught uses power series
to estimate the terms of the polynomial to model positions of the bodies.
